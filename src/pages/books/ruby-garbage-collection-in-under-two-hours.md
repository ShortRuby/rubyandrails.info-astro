In this ebook, we'll learn all about how Ruby garbage collection works: from discussing Ruby's memory layout to distinct strategies its garbage collector uses. Many of us program in Ruby for years without ever actually deeply understanding how Ruby garbage collection is seamlessly managing memory behind the scenes.... until now! This ebook will pull back the veil on Ruby garbage collection, leading us to actually understand what's happening behind the scenes, and be able to reason deeply about how Ruby's memory is working.

We'll cover the Tri-Color Mark and Sweep algorithm, generational GC, incremental GC, compaction, and the future of Ruby garbage collection.
