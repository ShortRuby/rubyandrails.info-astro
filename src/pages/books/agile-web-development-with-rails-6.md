## What is "Agile Web Development with Rails 6" about?
Learn Rails the way the Rails core team recommends it, along with the tens of thousands of developers who have used this broad, far-reaching tutorial and reference. 

## Who should read "Agile Web Development with Rails 6"?
If you’re new to Rails, you’ll get step-by-step guidance. If you’re an experienced developer, get the comprehensive, insider information you need for the latest version of Ruby on Rails. 

## What will you learn in "Agile Web Development with Rails 6"
We start with a step-by-step walkthrough of building a real application, and in-depth chapters look at the built-in Rails features. Follow along with an extended tutorial as you write a web-based store application. Eliminate tedious configuration and housekeeping, seamlessly incorporate Ajax and JavaScript, send and receive emails, manage background jobs with ActiveJob, and build real-time features using WebSockets and ActionCable. Test your applications as you write them using the built-in unit, integration, and system testing frameworks, internationalize your applications, and deploy your applications easily and securely. 

New in this edition is coverage of Action Mailbox, which allows you to receive emails in your app, as well as Action Text, a zero-configuration rich text editing feature.
