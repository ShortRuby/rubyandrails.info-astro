## What is "Component-based Rails Applications" about?
Component-Based Rails is a proven method to manage the complexity of large applications. It ensures that we can maintain development speed, quality, and fun throughout the life cycle of applications. Components do this by enabling conversations about high-level structures that lead to improved communication of intent, more collaboration opportunities, and better maintenance capabilities.

As Rails applications grow, even experienced developers find it difficult to navigate code bases, implement new features, and keep tests fast. Components are the solution, and Component-Based Rails Applications shows how to make the most of them.

One step at a time, Hagemann demonstrates how to revamp Rails applications to exhibit visible, provably independent, and explicitly connected parts–thereby simplifying them and making them far easier for teams to manage, change, and test. Throughout, he introduces design concepts and techniques you can use to improve applications of many kinds, even if they weren’t built with Rails or Ruby

## Who should read "Component-based Rails Applications"?
Writing for programmers and software team leads who are comfortable with Ruby and Rails, Stephan Hagemann introduces a practical, start-to-finish methodology for modernizing and restructuring existing Rails applications.
