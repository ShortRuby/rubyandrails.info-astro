## What is "The Rails and Hotwire Codex" about?
This book will teach you the skills to push Rails and Hotwire to the max.

## Who should read "The Rails and Hotwire Codex"?
This book assumes basic familiarity with Ruby and Rails. 

While junior to mid-level Rails developers will get the most value out of this book, I believe every single Rails developer will learn something significant.

## What will you learn in "The Rails and Hotwire Codex"

This book will teach you the skills to push Rails and Hotwire to the max.

**How to build an app for Web, iOS and Android**
We'll build a neighborhood marketplace app à la Gumtree or Craigslist. We'll call it Piazza. Alongside the Rails app, we'll also build iOS and Android apps using Turbo Native.

**Authentication and Authorization from scratch**
These are core concepts used in every single web app, and having a working understanding of what goes on under the hood is essential. That's why, in this book, we build them from scratch instead of using a gem.

**Shipping production quality code**
Far too many tutorials come with a caveat of "but don’t do this in production". They rarely explain what one should do in production. None of that nonsense. Everything in this book is 100% production ready!

**Internationalization and Localization**
Internationalizing an app from the get-go keeps all the user facing text out of the views. This keeps the code clean, makes it easier to test, and the app is ready to be localized when required.

**Every single Rails sub-framework**
Action Mailer, Active Storage, Action Text, Active Job, Action Cable, Action Mailbox. We'll build features using them all!

**PostgreSQL powered search**
It's hard to imagine a modern web app without search. PostgreSQL packs in quite a punch with its full-text search feature. We'll build a search engine using it.

**Deploying the app to Render**
Heroku is frozen in time. Render is the future. We'll deploy services to run Rails, Sidekiq, PostgreSQL and Redis.
