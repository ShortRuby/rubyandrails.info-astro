## What is "99 Bottles of OOP" about?
This book contains an extended refactoring, and it details the rationale behind every change. It is a hands-on workbook rather than a list of theoretical ideas. It explains how to use the principles of object-oriented design to guide, not just the final arrangement of code, but each decision about what line of code to write next.

It teaches the theory of what good OO looks like, but even better, it supplies step-by-step guidance about how to achieve it.
