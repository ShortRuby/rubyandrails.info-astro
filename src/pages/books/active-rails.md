## What is "Active Rails" about?
This book will teach you the fundamentals of building a Rails application from the ground-up, complete with strict adherence to TDD and BDD.

## Who should read "Active Rails"?
This book assumes knowledge of HTML, CSS and some Ruby. No Rails knowledge is required for this book; we'll teach you what you need to know!

## What will you learn in "Active Rails"
This book will show you how to build a fully-featured Rails 6 application that includes:

- CSS styles
- Authentication & Authorization
- File uploading
- Sending & receiving email
- Deployment

This book follows community-approved standards of developing a Rails application. We use RSpec and Capybara for testing, Bootstrap for styling, and Devise for authentication. There's also Active Storage for file loading, Action Mailer for sending email and Heroku for deployment.
