This book is an up-to-date, well-organized knowledge base for anyone dealing with CSV files as a Ruby developer. From simple actions like reading and creating CSV files to processing CSV with Rails, parsing large files, and using advanced preprocessors, this book will be your companion.

This is a book by Paweł Dąbrowski, creator of the Long Live Ruby blog. I have been working with CSV and Ruby for over 9 years when building small startups and large enterprise applications used by companies from the Fortune 500 list. This PDF is a condensed knowledge that will help you to build apps and solve problems.
