If you've tried to learn Rails testing, maybe you've been stuck on these common testing questions... 
- What should I write tests for?
- How can I make testing a habitual part of my development workflow?
- What test framework should I use, MiniTest or RSpec?
- What level of test coverage do I need?
- Do I need to be doing TDD 100% of the time in order to be doing it "right"?
- What are the various Rails testing tools and how do I use them?
