The second edition of the best-selling Multitenancy with Rails book, full of new tricks + approaches to the multitenancy problems.

This book will demonstrate how to add multitenancy features to an existing Rails application, and also how to charge money for those features using the Braintree and Stripe payment gateways.

What's a multi-tenanted application? Think of applications like GitHub, where each user or organisation can have their own separate area within the application. Or how about Heroku where each user has their own separate app group. Those are multi-tenanted applications.

In this book we'll be adding multitenancy features to an already-established Rails codebase using some seriously good best practices, working with tools and processes like Behaviour-Driven Development, and PostgreSQL schemas. Along the way we'll discover that while something may seem like the best tool for the job, it may have show-stopping caveats.

In Chapter 5, the book covers how to use Braintree to make processing subscription payments for your multitenanted site a breeze. If Braintree isn't your thing, then Chapter 6 uses Stripe to do the same thing.
