Selenium WebDriver is a popular browser automation framework, testers or developers with Selenium skills are in high demand. It is easy to get started with Selenium, but do you use effectively for testing real-world test scenarios? Such as data driving test from an Excel spreadsheet and handling pop up dialogs.

Selenium WebDriver Recipes will show you solutions to your problems from the experts who have already solved them. All recipe test scripts  (~200 in Ruby language) are ready-to-run, i.e., I created the target web pages and test sites, so that you can simply find the recipes and run, in a matter of seconds. Owning this book is like having a test automation coach sitting next to you.
