## What is "Deployment from Scratch" about?
Demystify running web applications in production. Learn the groundwork for setting up Linux virtual servers and containers. Provision web servers and databases. Stop guessing and learn from scratch.

## Who should read "Deployment from Scratch"?
I wrote the book for software engineers, programmers, indie hackers, and makers on the web. Inside I teach system administration, server provisioning, and deployment of web applications. It's designed to be both a good first exposure and a great second dive-in.

## What will you learn in "Deployment from Scratch"
- A distilled knowledge of a few books in a single packaging written by a former professional Linux packager. Everything from network theory to encrypting database backups. 26 chapters of great content.
- Scripted real-world demonstrations using just plain Bash. They will help you understand more about good system defaults, secure configuration, and how things work if they are not buried in thousands of lines of higher-level tooling.
- Checklists and cheatsheets for your later reference
- Example Dockerfiles for inspiration.

I use Ruby and Python for the examples, but you can follow easily even if you come from a different programming language background. More than 90% of the book is language-independent. I use Rocky Linux 8 and CentOS 8 as examples.
