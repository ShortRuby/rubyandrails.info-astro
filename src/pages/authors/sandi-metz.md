Hi, I'm Sandi and I'm a programmer.

I'm also a teacher, author and sometime consultant, but I teach, write and consult about programming so it all starts here.

In the past 30+ years I have written innumerable applications, a surprising number of which are still running today. Dealing with long lived applications has left me deeply biased towards creating practical solutions that produce working software that is easy to change.
