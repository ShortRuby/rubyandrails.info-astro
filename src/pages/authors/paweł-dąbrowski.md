I am a software engineer with more than 13 years of commercial experience, currently working as a Chief Technology Officer. Ruby is my programming language of choice, but I also work with JavaScript, Node.js, Go, Python, and a range of DevOps technologies and tools.

I focus on building the right mindset for quickly learning different technologies and selecting the best tools for the given problem rather than sticking to one technology and not taking any chance to try something else. I write for both human beings and computers, which resulted in hundreds of articles that I wrote and projects that I contributed to.
