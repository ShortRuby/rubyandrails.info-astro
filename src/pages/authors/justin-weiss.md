A software engineer at Aha!. I first found Ruby in 2004, and it's been my favorite language ever since. Ruby brought the joy of programming back to me after years of Java, and I'll always love it for that.

I've written a few popular Ruby gems, including robut and resque_unit, and I've contributed to many more.

I live in Seattle, WA with my beautiful wife and two daughters.
