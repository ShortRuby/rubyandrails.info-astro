My name is Alexandre Rousseau and I am a Rails developer with more than 4 years of experience (at the time of writing). I am currently a partner in a company (iSignif) where I build and maintain a SAAS product using Rails. 

I also contribute to the Ruby community by producing and maintain some gems that you can consult on my Rubygems.org profile. Most of my projects are on Github so don't hesitate to follow me.
