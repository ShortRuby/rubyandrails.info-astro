My name is Dean and I run the Deanin YouTube channel. I've created over 150 programming tutorials, covering Ruby on Rails 5 to Rails 7, as well as tutorials on game development and procedural generation, fluid simulations, React and Vue, and plenty of other topics.

I have a Computer Science degree from Oakland University, and worked as a software engineer before being promoted to Product Manager and Team Lead my first year on the job.

I'm also always learning, so I know what it feels like to be learning. This allows me to create accessible learning materials that don't require you to pause and rewind multiple times in order to figure out how I did what I did.
