I'm a self taught programmer with over 10 years experience.

I joined Leanpub to share my knowledge and experience.

I started my own company, a software house, in the year 2010.

I coded lots of projects throughout those years trying out lots of stuffs like

ObjectiveC, Ruby on Rails, Nodejs, Swift, Java, Kotlin, Dart, Golang, ionic, react-native, Vue, React, ....

Deployed them on a bunch for infrastructures

Bare Metal, Government Cloud, VPS, Digital Ocean, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and on some Serverless arch

Taught Internet Programming to 70+ students in University as part-time lecturer in Thailand.

Trained over 100+ people in iOS Basic and Advance courses ages ago when there were no Swift.

Taught high school math for a year, 36 hours a week.

My dream is to start a school where all students can do what the love. (and not hate Math)

Obviously, it takes a lot of money to start a school. If you can fund me a few million $ to start a school in Thailand, Please contact me.

I hope you enjoy my books.
