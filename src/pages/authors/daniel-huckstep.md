I am a code mechanic near Annapolis Royal, NS, Canada.

- University of Alberta graduate (Software Engineering, 2009)
- Blogger (technical and other)
- Gamer (PC, Xbox, DS)
- Mountain Biker
- Musician (Guitar)
- Rocker of dreadlocks (since 2003)
- Farmer
- Sneakerhead

I enjoy good food, better wine, and mechanical watches. I work hard and play hard. I get the job done and get it done right the first time. I speak my mind and listen when others speak theirs.
