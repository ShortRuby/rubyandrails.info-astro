Well, hello there! I'm Erin, a programmer, author, and coach living in Ontario. (You may know me by a different first name, but I've been answering to “Erin” since 2017.)

One of my favorite things to do—whether the activity is programming, cooking, board games, or race walking—is to immerse myself in a skill and then share what I've learned.

For something technical like software testing, this means writing books such as Effective Testing With RSpec 3. 

For physical skills like race walking, it means coaching teams of athletes.
