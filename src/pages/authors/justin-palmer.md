Previously, I was a Designer and Principal Engineer at GitHub. Before that, I was Shopify's first Designer. I've been working on the web since 1998 and have used Rails since its early days. I love Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript (this site uses Svelte!), but after taking a hiatus from Rails I found myself missing the productivity and joy I was able to acheive with it.
