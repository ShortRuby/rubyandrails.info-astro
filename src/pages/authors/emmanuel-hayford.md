I’m an expatriate Ruby programmer based in Poland. I currently work as a software engineer at AirHelp and although I try to avoid it, I can work with some frontend technologies.

Up until 2016, I played active football. These days I’m learning more about HTTP/2 and the internals of web frameworks like Ruby on Rails. Besides staring at computer screens, I like astrophysics and boxing. I co-edit This Week In Rails, the official Ruby on Rails newsletter.

At the moment, I’m working on my first book; a collection of Ruby idioms, tips and tricks with explanation and use cases.

I share Ruby, Rails and web development tips on Twitter frequently.
