I've been using Ruby for more than a decade. During that time, I've presented and written about Ruby including 13 articles in Ruby Weekly. I organize the Dallas Ruby Brigade and participate in open source. 

My most successful contribution is the ActiveInteraction gem with over 1.8k stars on GitHub.

While doing all of this I've gained a strong understanding of Ruby and I'm excited to share what I've learned.
