I've been working on the web since the mid-90s. In 2006, feeling burned out after 10 years as a Java developer, I rediscovered my love of coding through Ruby on Rails, and I've been at it ever since.

Like a lot of new arrivals to the community, I liked the integration of tests as first-class citizens of the framework, but at that point, I had almost no experience with test automation. So after years of faking it, I decided to make writing great tests my super power and to help other developers learn to do the same.
